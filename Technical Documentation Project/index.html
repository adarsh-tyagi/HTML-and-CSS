          <p>C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development.
Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (There are few programs that may compile in C, but not in C++).</p>
          <ul>
            <li>C is highly portable; programs once written in C can be run on other machines with minor or no modification.</li>
            <li>C does not provide Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.</li>
            <li>The modular structure makes code debugging, maintenance, and testing easier.
</li>
          </ul>

          <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language. C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has a rich libray support and a variety of data-types.</li>
            <li>C++ programs excel in execution speed. Since, it is a compiled language, and also hugely procedural. Newer languages have extra in-built default features such as grabage-collection, dynamic typing etc.</li>
            <li>C++ is a compiled language, contributing to its speed.</li>

          <p>JAVA was developed by Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1991, later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It was developed by James Gosling and Patrick Naughton. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs.

Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. A general-purpose programming language made for developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Compiler converts source code to bytecode and then the JVM executes the bytecode generated by the compiler. </li>
            <li>Java is one of the simple languages as it does not have complex features like pointers, operator overloading, Multiple inheritance, Explicit memory allocation. </li>
            <li>Java supports multithreading. It is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU.</li>
          </ul>
          <code>
            <h4>class HelloWorld {</h4>
            <h4>public static void main(String[] args) {</h4>
            <h4>System.out.println("Hello, World!"); }}</h4>

          <p>C# is a general-purpose, modern and object-oriented programming language pronounced as “C sharp”. It was developed by Microsoft led by Anders Hejlsberg and his team within the .Net initiative and was approved by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and International Standards Organization (ISO). C# is among the languages for Common Language Infrastructure and the current version of C# is version 7.2. C# is a lot similar to Java syntactically and is easy for the users who have knowledge of C, C++ or Java.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>C# is a high-level language so it is closer to other popular programming languages like C, C++, and Java and thus becomes easy to learn for anyone.</li>
            <li>C# is widely used in game development and will continue to dominate.</li>
            <li>The larger the community the better it is as new tools and software will be developing to make it better.</li>
          </ul>
          <code>
            <h4>namespace HelloWorld {<h4>

              <h4>class Hello {</h4>

              <h4>System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); }}}</h4>

          <p>PHP can actually do anything related to server-side scripting or more popularly known as the backend of a website. For example, PHP can receive data from forms, generate dynamic page content, can work with databases, create sessions, send and receive cookies, send emails etc. There are also many hash functions available in PHP to encrypt user’s data that makes PHP secure and reliable to be used as a server-side scripting language. So these are some of the abilities of PHP that makes it suitable to be used as server-side scripting language.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Websites like www.facebook.com, www.yahoo.com are also built on PHP.</li>
            <li>One of the main reason behind this is that PHP can be easily embedded in HTML files and HTML codes can also be written in a PHP file.</li>
            <li>The thing that differentiates PHP with client-side language like HTML is, PHP codes are executed on server whereas HTML codes are directly rendered on the browser. PHP codes are first executed on the server and then the result is returned to the browser.</li>

          <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform and interpreted scripting language. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
            <li> It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. Like if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            <li>JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation. Earlier websites were mostly static, after JS was created dynamic Web sites were made.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code. Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently. There are two major Python versions: Python 2 and Python 3. Both are quite different.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Python has been growing in popularity over the last few years. The 2018 Stack Overflow Developer Survey ranked Python as the 7th most popular and the number one most wanted technology of the year.</li>
            <li>Many languages are compiled, meaning the source code you create needs to be translated into machine code, the language of your computer’s processor, before it can be run. </li>
            <li>Because Python code is interpreted and not compiled into native machine instructions, code written for one platform will work on any other platform that has the Python interpreter installed. </li>
          </ul>
